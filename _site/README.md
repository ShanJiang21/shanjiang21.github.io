# Intro: Shan's personal website

This is Shan's personal website for displaying projects and blog posts. Welcome to share your ideas with me. The theme is forked from [Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll), you can also choose an easier Wordpress or Hexo framework for hosting your blog, so that you can escape from the annoying debugging process :).


### Remain unsolved

- [x] Add catalogue for posts in blog;
- [x] Removed the page visit widget;
- [x] Easier ways to support the math equations;
- [x] Markdown Post header problem;
- [ ] Mathjax Configuration issue;
- [ ] Updating the gallery border css for image organization;
- [ ] Revise CSS for Code chunk;
- [ ] Support for bilingual settings


#### Community Responsibility

Personally, I strongly support this project: [996 vs ICU project](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU/tree/master/blacklist) as I believe all lives matter.
